                Stepped into the showbiz industry about 13 years ago, popular actress Zakia Bari Mamo received the
                prestigious National Film Award as the best actress for her amazing portrayal in her maiden film
                ‘Daruchini Dwip’ directed by actor-director Tauquir Ahmed. Now, the actress once again will be seen in
                Tauquir-directed Eid special tele-drama titled ‘Swarnalata’, which has been scripted by celebrated
                actress and playwright Bipasha Hayat. DhakaLive has news that the shooting of the tele-drama has been
                already concluded in Rajendrapur of Gazipur. Mamo has portrayed a lead role opposite Tauquir Ahmed in
                the tele-drama. Mamo said about working in ‘Swarnalata’, “I was recognized as an actress at national
                level by working in Tauquir Ahmed-directed film. For this, I always have a special respect and love for
                him. Tauquir Ahmed is a talented actor, director and brilliant filmmaker. Although, I did not work in
                any other film under his direction after ‘Daruchini Dwip’. But still, the film itself was a milestone
                for me. We walked down the memory lane to recall the days of ‘Daruchini Dwip’ during the shoot of
                ‘Swarnalata’.” “On the other hand, Bipasha Hayat is also one of my favourite actresses. I really miss
                her acting nowadays on the screen. Her writing is, as always, amazing. An artiste can really bring out
                the best in their performance, if the drama is written by a talented playwright. I aspire to work in the
                dramas written by her in the coming days. I hope the audience will really enjoy ‘Swarnalata’,” the
                actress added.‘Swarnalata’ will be aired on RTV in the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha!
